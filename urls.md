# class github links


GitHub allow you to store software projects in a  _repository_; these
"repos" can be public or private, and allow you to track and 'push' incremental changes
to your projects.


Assuming your username is `kuure`:
- your main GitHub page is at <https://github.com/kuure>
- your repositories are at <https://github.com/kuure?tab=repositories>
- If you create a repository named `kuure.github.io`, anything pushed to that repo will be live on the web at <https://kuure.github.io>

The live pages don't refresh immediately; it may take a few minutes for pushed
changes to appear.

Finally, the `kuure.github.io` repo must be set to __public__; to do this
this, click on the repo's "settings" tab and scroll down to the section
labeled "Danger Zone" and click the "Change visibility" button.
