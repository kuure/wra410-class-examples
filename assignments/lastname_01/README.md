# README.md


There are two stylesheets - `good.css`, and  `bad.css`. There is a small
amount of JavaScript code in the HTML document that randomly picks one of
them to use each time the page is loaded.

Your job is to make _two_ different menus using the same valid HTML5
`<nav>` element structure  - one that looks good and behaves well, and one
that should be as ugly and unusable as you would like it to be.

You must use at least _one_ CSS transition in each CSS file. 


Please detail your process, any people you may have worked with, specific
tutorials that may have found useful, tales of your interactions with
AI, or anything else you might want to document in the space below:
