	<h1>Exasperated Case Generator</h1>


	<!--

	 So what does an application like this need in order to function?

	 In the HTML:
	  an HTML element that allows a user to input text
	  an element that can have an image as a background
	  a place to put the user text over the image

	In the CSS:
		set the image to be the background of the container
		make the text white Impact font
		give the text a text shadow so it will show up better over the image

	In the JavaScript:
		code that listens for the input event on the text box
		code that grabs the current value of the input box
		code that randomly upper or lowercases each letter of the string
		code that puts the text from the input into the output container

	-->



	<!-- an element that allows a user to input text -->
	<input type="text" class='inputBox' autofocus>

	<!-- an element that can have an image as a background -->
	<div class="imageContainer"> 
		<!-- a place to put the user text over the image -->
		<p class="outputBox"></p>
	</div>
	

	<!-- link to the script, right before the close of the body tag -->
	<script src="js/script.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
