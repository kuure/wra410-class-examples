# Accessibility


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility):


> Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that
> prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities.
> When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal
> access to information and functionality. 


Specific goals of accessible design include a focus on developing sites that
take into account users with visual, motor or mobility, auditory, seizure, or
cognitive disability. 

Using semantic HTML - which provides specific context for each part of your
document - is a major aspect of accessible design. Other things to consider
are:

- providing comprehensive alternate text for images
- optimizing navigation to enable screen readers and to allow for users who cannot use mice or trackpads
- increasing contrast of text
- not using flashing visual effects
- providing captions for video content.


## W3C Guidelines

The World Wide Web consortium has created the [Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), currently at
version 2.0

Again, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines)

	
> It consists of twelve guidelines (untestable) organized under four principles
> (websites must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust). Each
> guideline has testable success criteria (61 in all).

> The W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2.0 is a list of techniques that help authors
> meet the guidelines and success criteria. The techniques are periodically
> updated whereas the principles, guidelines and success criteria are stable
> and do not change.




## Principles

### Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- Guideline 1.1: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
- Guideline 1.2: Time-based media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
- Guideline 1.3: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
- Guideline 1.4: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

### Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- Guideline 2.1: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
- Guideline 2.2: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
- Guideline 2.3: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
- Guideline 2.4: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

### Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

- Guideline 3.1: Make text content readable and understandable.
- Guideline 3.2: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
- Guideline 3.3: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

### Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide
variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- Guideline 4.1.: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.


## Legal Requirements

There are many places that have some sort of legal requirement regarding
accessibility. In the United States, [Section 508 Amendment to the
Rehabilitation Act of
1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973)
governs federal accessibility, requiring that "agencies must give employees
with disabilities and members of the public access to information that is
comparable to the access available to others". 

- [https://www.section508.gov/](https://www.section508.gov/)

The [Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990)
was a civil rights law that added protections to people with physical or mental
disabilities. It requires employers to provide "reasonable accommodations"" to
employees with disabilities, and imposes accessibility requirements on public
accommodations.

This [99 Percent Invisible podcast about curb
cuts](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/) goes into detail about
the history of disability rights and activism; curb cuts are often cited as a
design feature that is unobtrusive yet hugely useful to people with
disabilites, but also has unexpected added benefits for others as well. 


## Testing

There are many sites and checklists that can provide guidance for complying with accessibility recommendations/requirements:

- Test your site with the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](http://wave.webaim.org/)
- [W3C Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/)
- [Web Accessibility Checklist](https://a11yproject.com/checklist)
- [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
- [https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)
